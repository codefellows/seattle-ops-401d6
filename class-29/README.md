# Modeling a Web Application

## Overview

The STRIDE model developed by Microsoft is a popular means of identifying computer threats, providing six major categories that most threats fall into. These threats can then be modelled into data flow diagrams (DFDs) to thoroughly visualize all movements of data in our system, granting a high level overview of processes, data stores, data flows, and trust boundaries. By utilizing threat models, protectors of essential computer systems can evaluate security threats in a systematic and structured fashion, allowing for more strategic and calculated formulation of defensive countermeasures.
