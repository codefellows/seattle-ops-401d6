# Mock Interviews

## Objectives

- Read all of the following instructions carefully.
- Act as an interviewer, giving a candidate the interview question(s)
- Score the candidate according to the [interview grading rubric](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1scthkmARfzAFZrSYAp6LA2coOaoWUWbSzMbtIU4jcHw/edit){:target="_blank"}
- You are free to offer suggestions or guidance (and see how they respond),  but don't solve it for the candidate.
- Record detailed notes on the rubric, to share with the candidate when the interview is complete.

## Interview questions

Don't look at the interview questions until you decide who will be the first interviewer.

- The first interviewer will ask [this question](https://codefellows.github.io/ops-401-cybersecurity-guide/curriculum/class-04/challenges/interview-01.html){:target="_blank"}.
- The second interviewer will ask [this question](https://codefellows.github.io/ops-401-cybersecurity-guide/curriculum/class-04/challenges/interview-02.html){:target="_blank"}.

## Interviewer Guidelines

Familiarize yourself with the grading rubric, so you know how to score the interview.

Security interviewers will commonly probe for depth of technical knowledge and test how well the candidate can articulate their expertise of the topic. In your interview attempt to cover multiple depths:

- Test for fundamental knowledge of the presented concept at a general high level.
- Test for how comprehensive their knowledge is by asking for the associated concepts in addition to the main concept.
- Test for contextual knowledge of why the concept is important and how it can be technically applied to a security operation. Optimally the candidate should describe a time they applied the concept hands-on.

As the interviewer, you are trying to determine the level at which the candidate fails to discuss the topic further. Add up all the points at the end, and record the total at the bottom of the page.

## Example

- Surface level: What is a kill chain?
- Mid level: What are the components of a kill chain?
- Deep level: How can the kill chain be applied on a SOC team, and why is it important?

## Submission Instructions

- Review the notes your interviewer recorded for you on the Rubric.
- Submit the final result of your interview as a candidate to Canvas:
  - Paste the link the rubric that evaluated you as a candidate (either a google doc, or a photo of a printout).
  - Comment on your submission with summary of how it went for you, what went well, and what you'd like to improve.
