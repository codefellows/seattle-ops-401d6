# Ops Challenge: Brute Force with Kali Linux

## Overview

A classic cyber attack used against authentication mechanisms is brute force, which consists of repeatedly attempting a new login credential until you succeed. In March 2020, it was estimated there were shy of one million* brute force attacks taking place per day against RDP authentication controls.

Today you will experiment with Kali Linux attack tools to practice brute force against SSH authentication.
