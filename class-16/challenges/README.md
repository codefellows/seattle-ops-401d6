# Ops Challenge: Automated Brute Force Wordlist Attack Tool Part 1 of 3

## Overview

To properly defend against the techniques used by modern threat actors, we need to have an idea of the tools they will be using against us in an effort to circumvent our defenses. A brute force attack is a type of computer hack that relies on guessing possible combinations of a targeted password until the correct password is discovered. Sometimes brute force attacks will be augmented with word lists to create what is known as a dictionary attack, a much more efficient approach that preys upon the human tendency to use easy or familiar passwords. 

Today you will begin to develop a custom tool that performs brute force attacks to better understand the types of automation employed by adversaries.
