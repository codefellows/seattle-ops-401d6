# Log Analysis with Splunk

## Overview

Now that we've established a basic foundation of how a SIEM is deployed and configured to ingest log data, the next step is to start making sense of the data and how it will aid us in our day-to-day security operations. Logs that the SIEM collects can contain telltale signs of malicious activity, or direct evidence of incident-related actions on systems. Finding such clues is like finding a "needle in a haystack" as you parse oceans of text in your investigation. Aspiring security operations professionals should practice log parsing, searching, and analysis often in order to derive value from a system like a SIEM.
