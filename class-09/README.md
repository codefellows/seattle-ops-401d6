# Public Key Infrastructure (PKI)

## Overview

A security professional, particularly at the entry level, should have a firm grasp of how and why public key encryption and public key infrastructure are used in various systems today. Useful for various authentication processes, PKI facilitates confidentiality at a technical level.

Today you will practice using OpenPGP, is an asymmetric PKI encryption solution for text, email, files, directories, and disk partitions. You will also utilize OpenSSL to practice PKI operations.

## Tasks

Your instructor will assign you a lab partner to help you complete Part 1 and Part 2 of this lab.

### Part 1: Staging

You will need two environments for today's lab:

- Windows 10
- Ubuntu Linux

First prepare the Windows 10 environment.

- Download and install [Gpg4win 3.1.13](https://www.gpg4win.org).

Next prepare the Ubuntu Linux environment.

- Download and install `gnupg2` and `gpa`.
