# Repo and Tooling

Today we will create your project repo and setup your tooling for project management.

## Deliverable

Each group will create a GitHub “Organization”, add team members as members of the organization, and create the repositories there. Don't forget to customize everyone's permissions so that all team members are an "Admin".

The name of the org and the repo should be **resume-ready**. Use the the problem domain or another professional-sounding team name. Don't call it `201Final` or `project-week` or `reeses-puffs` or similar.

> This project may well be a key piece of your resume. Potential employers will be looking at this project and it’s documentation. Name it accordingly.

## Build your repos:

1. Create a repo to link the Team Agreement doc, System Selection doc, topologies/visuals, SOP docs and the slideshow.

- Create a basic `README.md` file within this repo that contains the names of all the members as well as a description of the project.
- The `README.md` file should be attractively formatted and include links to each of your GitHub and LinkedIn profiles.
- Link the PM tool your team is using to manage tasks.
- On this `README.md` file, label and link all SOPs.
  - For **each** SOP included in your MSP SOW deliverable, attribute authorship to the team member.
  - SOPs can either be:
    - Worked on as Google Docs and committed as PDFs.
    - Worked on and committed as Markdown files.
- Commit topology images and other visuals to the repo and link them on the `README.md` file.
- Include any relevant information required for the operation of the demonstrated system.
  - Any config files which you created or customized, exported in an appropriate format (such as json)
- When completed, export the slide deck as a PDF, commit it to the repo and link it to the `README.md` file.
- When it becomes available, link the recording of your presentation.

1. Create any additional repos for each individual script.

- Create a basic `README.md` file within the repo that contains the names of all the members and a description of the script including the WHAT and WHY.
  - Please list any resources or references used in creating the script here as well.
- Commit the script in it’s own file and link it to the `README.md` file.
  - Don’t forget to leave comments in your code!

## Project Management Tools

Make sure everyone, including your grader and the audience, has access and correct permissions to the tool you are using. Link your Project Management tool in the documentation repo on GitHub.

Please use one of these tools listed below:

1. [Jira](https://www.atlassian.com/software/jira){:target="_blank"}
1. [Trello](https://trello.com/){:target="_blank"}
1. [GitHub Projects](https://help.github.com/en/articles/about-project-boards){:target="_blank"}

Build out sections to help organize tasks. Try using labels such as “To Do”, “In Progress”, “Done” and “Stretch Goals”. Organize your PM Tool however you think is best for your team!

Grant the instructor access to your project management tool for review during daily stand-ups.

## Presentation Deck

Make a single copy of the [Presentation Deck Template](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1iv8uB6H0P49RN9IF6cYA5lpfiuL4WBGQqcbEu6Q4JAA/edit#slide=id.g2accd1c413_1_55){:target="_blank"}. Share your copy will all team members, so everyone is working from the same slideshow.

Link the shared doc in your PM tool.

The presentation should follow exactly from the [template slide deck](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1iv8uB6H0P49RN9IF6cYA5lpfiuL4WBGQqcbEu6Q4JAA/edit#slide=id.g2accd1c413_1_55){:target="_blank"}. Ensure your timing is no more than 15 minutes long, including some time at the end for questions.

Each member should introduce themselves with their personal pitch.

Each member of the team must have at least one demo and one speaking part. It is okay to use notes if you are nervous about forgetting what to talk about. Some of the areas to discuss include:

- An introduction of the client company and their requests and needs.
- A demonstration of the solutions with an explanation of the WHAT and WHY behind it.
- A technical obstacle or two and how those obstacles were overcome.
- A portion of the final solution that each team member is particularly proud of.

See the Project Guidelines for list of required components.
