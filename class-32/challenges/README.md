# Ops Challenge: Signature-based Malware Detection Part 2 of 3

## Overview

Detection and remediation of malware is the core function of many security products, and an optional secondary feature on others like perimeter firewalls and proxy servers.

By generating a hash value derived from a target file, we can uniquely identify that file either now or later on. This facilitates the security process known as hash validation. Today you will continue development of your own basic antivirus tool in Python.
