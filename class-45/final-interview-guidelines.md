# Cybersecurity 401 Final Interview Guidelines

Cybersecurity 401 students will be scheduled for a mock job interview with a member of the Code Fellows instructional staff in lieu of a final exam. Here's what you can expect on interview day.

## Specifications

The logistics per interview are as follows:

- The interview will be scheduled for 60 minutes.
- The interviewer will score the candidate according to the [Technical Ops Interview Rubric](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1scthkmARfzAFZrSYAp6LA2coOaoWUWbSzMbtIU4jcHw/edit){:target="_blank"}.
  - The completed rubric will be given to the candidate.

> Practice makes perfect! Obtain and apply valuable feedback from the classmates you've worked with on technical interviews throughout this course.

## Interview questions

Question prompts will be drawn from topics found on the [final interview study guide](./final-interview-study-guide.md).

The scope of each question will be dictated by the interviewer. Students are encouraged to ask clarifying questions and be thoughtfully engaged with the interviewer throughout the process.

Because of the Code Fellows "stacked learning" approach to instruction, pre-requisite proficiencies and knowledge gained in prior Ops sequence courses may also be tested. For example, questions like "What is the OSI model?" are fair game in an Ops 401 final interview.

> Modern security professionals should have a strong grounding in IT fundamentals. Throughout the Ops sequence you have studied everything from "What is a computer?" to "Client-server architecture." Be prepared to deep-dive on any fundamental topics presented throughout your Ops journey here at Code Fellows!

Students are not to disclose the contents of a final interview to other students beyond what is presented here.

## Structure

At the beginning of the interview appointment, a time-limited ten-question final knowledge assessment will be given to the candidate for completion.

- This is an individual test: you may NOT collaborate with others, nor use outside resources. A score of 80% or higher is required to pass the exam.
- Passing the assessment is required in order to pass the overall interview. Upon completion, the candidate will next proceed into the technical interview portion described below.
- This is meant to simulate an interview environment, or certification exam, where you must rely on the knowledge gained from your studies.

The second part of the appointment will be primarily structured as a face-to-face verbal interview via video conference, although students are also encouraged to communicate and demonstrate technical proficiencies where appropriate.

## Documentation

The interviewer will take detailed notes on the Rubric form. Points should be assessed for every item on the Rubric. The total points should be summed and recorded on the form. The outcome will be recorded to the pass/fail assignment on Canvas.

## Retake Policy

Upon failing a technical interview, a student may request another interview. To request another attempt, the student must submit a written solution doc to the instructor that correctly and comprehensively answers the previous interview question prompt topic(s). The student must receive instructor approval to proceed with another attempt.
