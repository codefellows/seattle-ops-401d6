# Persistence

## Overview

As documented in MITRE ATT&CK® tactic TA0003, adversaries upon establishing a foothold will apply various methods of implementing a "backdoor" to the targeted system, generally known as establishing persistence. Our lab today explores how this is done using the infamous attack framework, PowerShell Empire. By reproducing the threat at a technical level, we can use this to build a model of the threat and hopefully implement proper defenses.
