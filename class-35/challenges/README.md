# Ops Challenge: Web Vulnerability Scanning with Nmap

## Overview

As security professionals we are sometimes called upon to evaluate web applications for vulnerabilities. In fact, many companies have "bug bounty" programs to encourage ethical hackers to find vulnerabilities in their applications by rewarding them with monetary payouts for significant findings. How are vulnerabilities discovered? This will be the topic in the coming module.
