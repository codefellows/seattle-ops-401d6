# Ops Challenge: File Encryption

## Overview

Encryption has been used since ancient times, long before computers ever became handheld devices with processing power rivaling that of old NASA supercomputers. A primary confidentiality tool, encryption can be used in a multitude of ways, including protecting data in motion and data at rest. Today you will practice encrypting and decrypting files, which constitute data at rest. You'll also get to see how data integrity can be validated using hashing.
