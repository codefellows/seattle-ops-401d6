# Log Clearing

## Overview

Defense evasion as documented in TA0005 is an important tactic used by threat actors to avoid detection by defensive systems. By damaging the integrity of event logs, threat actors hope to not only avoid detection but may also seek to avoid prosecution and accountability for their actions on objectives. T1070 tells us that threat actors will often go to great lengths to cover their tracks by deleting evidence of their actions. One such method is log clearing, which we'll explore today as our sample technique to which we'll apply the Atomic Testing Cycle.
