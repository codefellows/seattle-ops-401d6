# Lab: Communicating Vulnerabilities to the Organization

## Overview

Throughout a security professional’s career, there will be critical confrontations where you’ll have a chance to pitch your idea, be it a request for funding or a change to operations. This day will be focused on how we can analyze a situation, produce output findings, and convert those findings into  developing a formal deliverable that is executive-friendly and rates vulnerabilities.
