- **How** (30 min)
How can the NIST RMF be implemented? (ref. [How to Apply the Risk Management Framework (RMF)](https://www.tripwire.com/state-of-security/featured/applying-risk-management-framework/))
  - Step 1: Categorize Information Systems
  - Step 2: Select Security Controls
  - Step 3: Implement Security Controls
  - Step 4: Assess Security Controls
  - Step 5: Authorize Information System
  - Step 6: Monitor Security Controls
Demonstrate
  - Select a sample scenario from [SANS Case Studies](https://www.sans.org/reading-room/whitepapers/casestudies)
  - Apply the NIST RMF together
