## Tasks

1. For a fictional (or real, if you have access to an org you can use as case study) organization, create an incident response plan deliverable. For missing technical details, you can make assumptions that parallel systems we have studied so far. E.g. assume they use an AWS cloud environment for infrastructure. Build a slide deck with visuals; do not compose a lengthy Word/PDF document.

### Part 1: Presentation Creation

  1. Overview
      1. Introduces the plan; details high-level goals, the scope of what's covered and assumptions that have been considered.
  2. Outline of roles and responsibilities
      1. Lists and discusses the duties and expectations of each of the team members.
  3. Detailed list of incidents requiring action
      1. Outlines the specific threats, exploits and situations that require formal incident response actions. The possibilities are endless, but could include denial-of-service attacks, malware infections, email phishing and lost or stolen laptops. Note: This is arguably the most important part of the incident response plan.
  4. Detection, investigation and containment procedures
      1. The beginning of the actual incident response procedures that you plan to use; this includes directives on tasks such as analyzing the situations, notifying team members, getting outside parties involved, securing the network, confirming the incident, gathering evidence and reporting on findings.
  5. Eradication steps
      1. Provides the general steps for cleaning up the incident and may include network traffic and system log analysis, forensics review and subsequent vulnerability testing to confirm resolution.
  6. The recovery phase
      1. Details tasks in the recovery phase, such as reinstalling or reimaging hosts, resetting passwords, and adjusting firewall rules and related network configurations.
  7. Breach notification
      1. Outlines the how and when to alert those impacted by a confirmed breach as required by contracts or law.
  8. Follow-up tasks
      1. Discusses additional reports, enhanced documentation and lessons learned that might come out of this phase.
  9. Call list (in the appendix)
      1. Provides contact information for incident response team members and involved outside vendors, such as internet service providers and cloud service providers.
  10. Testing scenarios (appendix)
      1. Outlines specific testing scenarios that have been or will be carried out.
  11. Revision history (appendix)
      1. Outlines details on plan updates and improvements, including who did it and when it was done.

### Part 2: Presentations
