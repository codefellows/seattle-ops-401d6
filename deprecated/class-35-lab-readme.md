# Lab: Secure Coding and Application Testing

## Overview

This class examines how web app vulnerabilities can be identified and prevented during the testing stage of an application development cycle. Weâ€™ll detect a SQL injection vulnerability using a fuzzing tool, reproduce it fully, and then look at how it can be prevented proactively.

## Resources

## Tasks

- Load up an open source fuzzing tool of your choice
- On the OWASP BWA, perform software testing using various methods
- Fuzz testing
- Input validation
- Generate findings
- Successfully perform an injection attack on the OWASP BWA using your findings

### Stretch Goal (Optional Objectives)
