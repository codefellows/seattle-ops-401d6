# Cloud Detective Controls

## Overview

Amazon GuardDuty is a threat detection service that continuously monitors for malicious activity and unauthorized behavior to protect AWS accounts, workloads, and data stored in Amazon S3, whereas AWS Security Hub provides a comprehensive view of the security state in AWS and helps check the environment against security industry standards and best practices. Now that we have logs being generated and ingested by CloudWatch, we can activate security features GuardDuty and Secure Hub to actively detect security issues such as IAM misconfigurations.
